When y ou st art the de sign f or a ne w app ide a, what do y ou de sign fir st? If it’ s
the na vigation bar at the top of the page , you’re making a mist ake.
The e asiest way to find y ourself frustr ated and stuck when w orking on a ne w
design is to st art by trying to “ design the app .” When most people think
about “ designing the app ”, the y’re thinking about the shell .
Should it ha ve a top na v, or a sidebar ?
Should the na vigation it ems be on the le ft, or on the right?
Should the page cont ent be in a cont ainer , or should it be full-width ?
Wher e should the logo go ?
The thing is, an “ app” is actually a collection of features. Bef ore you’ve
designed a f ew features, you don ’t even ha ve the inf ormation y ou need to
make a decision about ho w the na vigation should w ork. No w onder it’ s
frustr ating!Inste ad of st arting with the shell, st art with a piece of actual functionality .
For example , say you’re building a flight booking ser vice. You could st art
with a f eature like “searching f or a flight” .
Your inter face will need:
•A field f or the depar ture city
•A field f or the de stination city
•A field f or the depar ture date
•A field f or the r eturn date
•A button to per form the se arch
Start with that.
Start with a f eature, not a la yout 8Hell, y ou might not e ven need that other stuff an yways — it w orked for
Google .
Start with a f eature, not a la yout 9Det ail come s later
In the e arlie st stages of de signing a ne w feature, it’s impor tant that y ou don ’t
get hung up making lo w-level decisions about things lik e typef aces,
shado ws, icons, etc .
That stuff will all matter e ventually , but it doe sn’t matter right no w.
If you ha ve trouble ignoring the det ails when w orking in a high fidelity
environment lik e the br owser or y our f avorite de sign tool, one trick Jason
Fried of Basecamp lik es to use is to de sign on paper using a thick Sharpie .
Obse ssing o ver little det ails just isn ’t possible with a Sharpie , so it can be a
great way to quickly e xplor e a bunch of diff erent la yout ide as.
Hold the color
Even when y ou’re ready to r efine an ide a in higher fidelity , resist the
tempt ation to intr oduce color right a way.By de signing in gr ayscale , you’re forced to use spacing, contr ast, and siz e to
do all of the he avy lifting.
It’s a little mor e challenging, but y ou’ll end up with a cle arer inter face with a
strong hier archy that’ s easy to enhance with color later .
Detail come s later 11Don ’t over-invest
The whole point of de signing in lo w-fidelity is to be able to mo ve fast, so y ou
can st art building the r eal thing as soon as possible .
Sketche s and wir eframe s are disposable — user s can ’t do an ything with
static mock ups. U se them to e xplor e your ide as, and le ave them behind
when y ou’ve made a decision.Detail come s later 12Don ’t de sign too much
You don ’t need to de sign e very single f eature in an app bef ore you mo ve on
to implement ation; in f act, it’ s better if y ou don ’t.
Figuring out ho w every feature in a pr oduct should inter act and ho w every
edge case should look is r eally har d, especially in the abstr act.
How should this scr een look if the user ha s 2000 cont acts?
Wher e should the err or me ssage go in this f orm?
How should this c alendar look when ther e are two e vents scheduled a t the
same time ?You’re setting y ourself up f or frustr ation b y trying to figur e this stuff out
using only a de sign tool and y our imagination.
Work in c ycles
Inste ad of de signing e verything up fr ont, w ork in shor t cycles. St art by
designing a simple v ersion of the ne xt feature you w ant to build.
Once y ou’re happ y with the basic de sign, make it r eal.
You’ll pr obably run into some une xpected comple xity along the w ay, but
that’ s the point — it’ s a lot e asier to fix de sign pr oblems in an inter face y ou
can actually use than it is to imagine e very edge case in adv ance .
Iterate on the w orking de sign until ther e are no mor e problems lef t to solv e,Don’t design too much 14then jump back into de sign mode and st art working on the ne xt feature.
Don’t get o verwhelmed w orking in the abstr act. Build the r eal thing as e arly
as possible so y our imagination doe sn’t have to do all the he avy lifting.
Be a pe ssimist
Don’t imply functionality in y our de signs that y ou ar en’t ready to build.
For example , say you’re working on a comment s ystem f or a pr oject
management tool. Y ou kno w that one da y, you’d like user s to be able to
attach file s to their comments, so y ou include an att achments section in
your de sign.
Don’t design too much 15You get deep into implement ation only to disco ver that suppor ting
attachments is going to be a lot more work than y ou anticipated. Ther e’s no
way you ha ve time to finish it right no w, so the whole commenting s ystem
sits on the backburner while y ou take car e of other prioritie s.
The thing is, a comment s ystem with no att achments w ould still ha ve been
better than no comment s ystem at all, but because y ou planned to include it
from da y one y ou’ve got nothing y ou can ship .
When y ou’re de signing a ne w feature,expect it to be har d to build.
Designing the smalle st useful v ersion y ou can ship r educe s that risk
consider ably.
If par t of a f eature is a “ nice-to-ha ve”,design it la ter. Build the simple v ersion
first and y ou’ll alw ays ha ve something to f all back on.Don’t design too much 16Choo se a per sonality
Every de sign has some sor t of per sonality . A banking site might tr y to
communicate secur eand professional , while a tr endy ne w startup might
have a de sign that f eels funand playful.
On the sur face, giving a de sign a par ticular per sonality might sound abstr act
and handw avy, but a lot of it is determined b y a few solid, concr ete f actor s.Font choice
Typogr aphy pla ys a huge par t in determining ho w a de sign f eels.
If you w ant an elegant or classic look, y ou might w ant to incorpor ate a serif
typef ace in y our de sign:
For a pla yful look, y ou could use a r ounded sans serif :
Choose a per sonality 18If you’re going f or a plainer look, or w ant to r ely on other elements to pr ovide
the per sonality , a neutr al sans serif w orks great:
Color
Ther e’s a lot of science out ther e on the ps ychology of color , but in pr actice ,
you really just need to pa y attention to ho w diff erent color s feel to y ou.
Blue is saf e and f amiliar — nobody e ver complains about blue:
Choose a per sonality 19Gold might sa y “expensiv e” and “ sophisticated”:
Pink is a bit mor e fun, and not so serious:
While tr ying to choose color s using only psychology isn ’t super pr actical — a
lot of it is just about what look s good to y ou — it can be helpful to think
about when y ou’re trying to under stand whyyou think a color is the right fit.Choose a per sonality 20Border r adius
As small of a det ail as it sounds, if and ho w much y ou round the corner s in
your de sign can ha ve a big impact on the o verall feel.
A small bor der r adius is pr etty neutr al, and doe sn’t really communicate
much of a per sonality on its o wn:
A lar ge bor der r adius st arts to f eel mor e pla yful:
Choose a per sonality 21…while no bor der r adius at all f eels a lot mor e serious or f ormal:
Whate ver you choose , it’s impor tant to st ay consistent. Mixing squar e
corner s with r ounded corner s in the same inter face almost alw ays look s
worse than sticking with one or the other .
Language
While not a visual de sign technique per se , the w ords you use in an inter face
have a massiv e influence on the o verall per sonality .
Using a le ss per sonal tone might f eel mor e official or pr ofessional:
Choose a per sonality 22…while using friendlier , mor e casual language mak es a site f eel, w ell,
friendlier :
Words ar e everywher e in a user inter face, and choosing the right one s is just
as (if not mor e) impor tant than choosing the right color or typef ace.
Deciding wha t you actually w ant
A lot of the time y ou’ll pr obably just ha ve a gut f eeling f or the per sonality
you’re going f or. But if y ou don ’t, a gr eat way to simplif y the decision is to
take a look at other site s used b y the people y ou w ant to r each.
If the y are mostly pr etty “ serious busine ss”, maybe that’ s how your site
should look too . If the y are mor e pla yful with a bit of humor , maybe that’ s a
better dir ection to t ake.
Just tr y not to borr ow too much fr om dir ect competitor s, you don ’t want to
look lik e a second-r ate v ersion of something else .Choose a per sonality 23Limit y our choice s
Having millions of color s and thousands of f onts to choose fr om might
sound nice in theor y, but in pr actice it’ s usually a par alyzing cur se.
And it’ s not just f onts and color s, either — y ou can e asily w aste time
agonizing o ver almost an y minor de sign decision.
Should this t ext be 12p x or 13p x?
Should this bo x shado w ha ve a 10 % opacity or a 15 % opacity?
Should this a vatar be 2 4px or 25p x tall?
Should I use a medium f ont weight f or this b utton or semibold?
Should this he adline ha ve a bott om mar gin o f 18p x or 2 0px?
When y ou’re de signing without constr aints, decision-making is tor ture
because ther e’s alw ays going to be mor e than one right choice .
For example , the se buttons all ha ve diff erent back ground color s, but it’ s
almost impossible to tell the diff erence betw een them b y just looking at
them.
How are you supposed to mak e a confident decision if none of the se w ould
really be bad choice s?Define s ystems in adv ance
Inste ad of hand-picking v alues from a limitle ss pool an y time y ou need to
make a decision, start with a smaller set o f options .
Don’t reach f or the color pick er every time y ou need to pick a ne w shade of
blue — choose fr om a set of 8- 10 shade s pick ed out ahe ad of time .
Similarly , don ’t tweak a f ont siz e one pix el at a time until it look s per fect.
Define a r estrictiv e type scale in adv ance and use that to mak e any futur e
font siz e decisions.
Limit y our choice s 25When y ou build s ystems lik e this, y ou only ha ve to do the har d work of
picking the initial v aluesonce inste ad of e very time y ou’re de signing a ne w
piece of UI. It’ s a bit mor e work up fr ont, but it’ s worth it — it’ll sa ve you a ton
of decision f atigue do wn the r oad.
Designing b y pr oce ss of elimina tion
When y ou’re de signing using a constr ained set of v alues, decision-making is
a lot e asier because ther e are a lot f ewer “right” choice s.
For example , say you’re trying to choose a siz e for an icon. Y ou’ve defined a
sizing scale in adv ance wher e your only small-to-medium siz ed options ar e
12px, 16p x, 24px, and 32p x.
To pick the be st option, st art by taking a gue ss at which one will look be st,
maybe 16p x. Then tr y the v alues on either side (12p x and 2 4px) for
comparison.
Chance s are, two of those options will seem lik eobviously bad choice s. If it’ s
the options on the outside , you’re done — the middle option is the only good
choice .Limit y our choice s 26If one of the outer options look s best, do another comparison using that
option as the “ middle ” value and mak e sur e ther e’s not a better choice .
This appr oach w orks for an ything wher e you’ve defined a s ystem. When
you’re limited to a set of options that all look notice ably diff erent, picking the
best one is a piece of cak e.
Systema tize everything
The mor e systems y ou ha ve in place , the f aster y ou’ll be able to w ork and the
less you’ll second gue ss your o wn decisions.
You’ll w ant s ystems f or things lik e:
•Font siz e
•Font w eight
•Line height
•Color
•Margin
•Padding
•Width
•Height
•Box shado wsLimit y our choice s 27•Border r adius
•Border width
•Opacity
…and an ything else y ou run into wher e it f eels lik e you’re laboring o ver a lo w-
level de sign decision.
You don ’t have to define all of this stuff ahe ad of time , just mak e sur e you’re
appr oaching de sign with a s ystem-f ocused mindset. L ook f or oppor tunitie s
to intr oduce ne w systems as y ou mak e ne w decisions, and tr y to a void
having to mak e the same minor decision twice .
Designing with s ystems is going to be a r ecurring theme thr oughout this
book, and in later chapter s we’ll talk about building a lot of the se systems in
finer det ail.Limit y our choice s 28Hier archy is E verythingNot all element s ar e equal
When y ou think of visual de sign as “ styling things so the y look good” , it’s
easy to see wh y it might f eel har d to achie ve without innate ar tistic t alent.
But it turns out that one of the bigge st factor s in making something “look
good” has nothing to do with super ficial styling at all.
Visual hierar chyrefers to ho w impor tant the elements in an inter face appe ar
in relation to one another , and it’ s the most eff ectiv e tool y ou ha ve for
making something f eel “ designed” .
When e verything in an inter face is competing f or attention, it f eels nois y and
chaotic , like one big w all of content wher e it’s not cle ar what actually
matter s:
When y ou deliber ately de-emphasiz e secondar y and ter tiary information,
and mak e an eff ort to highlight the elements that ar e most impor tant, the
result is immediately mor e ple asing, e ven though the color scheme , font
choice , and la yout ha ven’t changed:
So ho w do y ou actually mak e this happen ? In the f ollowing chapter s, we’ll
cover a number of specific str ategie s you can use to intr oduce hier archy into
your de signs.Not all elements ar e equal 31Size isn ’t everything
Relying too much on f ont siz e to contr ol your hier archy is a mist ake — it
often le ads to primar y content that’ s too lar ge, and secondar y content that’ s
too small.
Inste ad of le aving all of the he avy lifting to f ont siz e alone , try using f ont
weight or color to do the same job .
For example , making a primar y element bolder lets y ou use a mor ereasonable f ont siz e, and of ten doe s a better job at communicating its
impor tance an yways:
Similarly , using a sof ter color f or suppor ting te xt inste ad of a tin y font siz e
makes it cle ar that the te xt is secondar y while sacrificing le ss on r eadability :
Size isn ’t everything 33Try and stick to tw o or thr ee color s:
•A dark color f or primar y content (lik e the he adline of an ar ticle )
•A grey for secondar y content (lik e the date an ar ticle w as published)
•A lighter gr ey for ter tiary content (ma ybe the cop yright notice in a
footer)
Similarly , two font w eights ar e usually enough f or UI w ork:
•A normal f ont w eight ( 400 or 5 00 depending on the f ont) f or most te xt
•A he avier f ont w eight (6 00 or 7 00) f or te xt you w ant to emphasiz e
Stay away from f ont w eights under 4 00 for UI w ork — the y can w ork f or
large he adings but ar e too har d to r ead at smaller siz es. If y ou’re consideringSize isn ’t everything 34using a lighter w eight to de-emphasiz e some te xt, use a lighter color or
smaller f ont siz e inste ad.Size isn ’t everything 35Don ’t us e gr ey te xt on color ed
back grounds
Making te xt a lighter gr ey is a gr eat way to de-emphasiz e it on white
back grounds, but it doe sn’t look so gr eat on color ed back grounds.
That’ s because the eff ect w e’re actually seeing with gr ey on white is reduced
contra st.Making the te xt closer to the back ground color is what actually helps cr eate
hierarchy, not making it light gr ey.
You might think that the e asiest way to achie ve this is to use white te xt and
reduce the opacity :
While this doesreduce the contr ast, it of ten r esults in te xt that look s dull,
washed out, and sometime s even disabled.Don’t use gr ey text on color ed back grounds 37Even w orse, using this appr oach on top of an image or pattern me ans the
back ground will sho w thr ough the te xt:
A better appr oach is to hand-pick a ne w color , based on the back ground
color .
Choose a color with the same hue , and adjust the satur ation and lightne ss
until it look s right to y ou:
Hand-picking a color this w ay mak es it e asy to r educe the contr ast without
the te xt looking f aded.Don’t use gr ey text on color ed back grounds 38Emphasiz e by de-emphasizing
Sometime s you’ll run into a situation wher e the main element of an inter face
isn’t standing out enough, but ther e’s nothing y ou can add to it to giv e it the
emphasis it needs.
For example , despite tr ying to mak e this activ e nav item “ pop” by giving it a
different color , it still doe sn’t really st and out compar ed to the inactiv e items:
When y ou run into situations lik e this, inste ad of tr ying to fur ther emphasiz e
the element y ou w ant to dr aw attention to , figur e out ho w you can de-
empha sizethe elements that ar e competing with it.
In this e xample , you could do that b y giving the inactiv e items a sof ter color
so the y sit mor e in the back ground:
You can apply this thinking to bigger piece s of an inter face as w ell. F orexample , if a sidebar f eels lik e it’s competing with y our main content ar ea,
don’t giv e it a back ground color — let the content sit dir ectly on the page

Emphasiz e by de-emphasizing 40Labels ar e a last r esort
Put do wn the acce ssibility pitchf ork — this isn ’t about f orms.
When pr esenting dat a to the user ( especially dat a from the dat abase ), it’s
easy to f all into the tr ap of displa ying it using a naiv elabel: v alue format.
The pr oblem with this appr oach is that it mak es it difficult to pr esent the
data with an y sor t of hier archy; every piece of dat a is giv en equal emphasis.
You might not need a label a t all
In a lot of situations, y ou can tell what a piece of dat a is just b y looking at the
format.
For example ,janedoe@e xample .com is an email addr ess,(555) 765-4321 is a
phone number and $19.99is a price .
When the f ormat isn ’t enough, the conte xt of ten is. When y ou see the phr ase
“Cust omer S uppor t”listed belo w someone ’s name in an emplo yee dir ector y,you don ’t need a label to mak e the connection that that is the depar tment
the per son w orks in.
When y ou’re able to pr esent dat a without labels, it’ s much e asier to
emphasiz e impor tant or identif ying inf ormation, making the inter face e asier
to use while at the same time making it f eel mor e “designed” .
Combine labels and v alue s
Even when a piece of dat a isn ’t completely cle ar without a label, y ou can
often a void adding a label b y adding clarif ying te xt to the v alue.
For example , if you need to displa y inventor y in an e-commer ce inter face,
inste ad of “In stock: 12 ”, try something lik e “12 lef t in stock” .
Labels ar e a last r esort 42If you’re building a r eal estate app , something lik e “Bedr ooms: 3 ” could
simply become “ 3 bedr ooms ”.
When y ou’re able to combine labels and v alues into a single unit, it’ s much
easier to giv e each piece of dat a me aningful styling without sacrificing on
clarity .
Labels ar e secondar y
Sometime s you reallydoneed a label; f or example when y ou’re displa ying
multiple piece s of similar dat a and the y need to be e asily scannable , like on
a dashboar d.Labels ar e a last r esort 43In the se situations, add the label, but tr eat it as suppor ting content. The dat a
itself is what matter s, the label is just ther e for clarity .
De-emphasiz e the label b y making it smaller , reducing the contr ast, using a
lighter f ont w eight, or some combination of all thr ee.
When to emphasiz e a label
If you’re de signing an inter face wher e you kno w the user will be looking f or
the label, it might mak e sense to emphasiz e the label inste ad of the dat a.
This is of ten the case on inf ormation-dense page s, lik e the technical
specifications of a pr oduct.
If a user is tr ying to find out the dimensions of a smar tphone , the y’re
probably scanning the page f or w ords lik e “depth ”, not “7 .6mm ”.
Labels ar e a last r esort 44Don’t de-emphasiz e the dat atoomuch in the se scenarios; it’ s still impor tant
information. Simply using a dark er color f or the label and a slightly lighter
color f or the v alue is of ten enough.Labels ar e a last r esort 45Separ ate visual hier archy from
document hier archy
It’s impor tant to use semantic mark up when building f or the w eb, which
means y ou’ll of ten be using he ading t ags lik eh1,h2, orh3if you decide to add
a title to par t of an inter face.
By def ault, w eb br owser s assign pr ogressively smaller f ont siz es to he ading
elements, so an h1is pr etty lar ge, and an h6is pr etty small. This can be
helpful f or document-style content lik e article s or document ation, but it can
encour age some bad decisions in application UIs.
Using an h1tag to add a title lik eManage A ccount to a page mak es per fect
sense semantically , but because w e’re trained to belie ve that h1elements
should be big, it’ s easy to f all into the tr ap of making those title s bigger than
they really need to be .
A lot of the time , section title s act mor e likelabels than he adings — the y are
suppor tive content, the y shouldn ’t be ste aling all the attention.
Usually the cont entin that section should be the f ocus, not the title . That
means that a lot of the time , title s should actually be pr etty small:
Taken to the e xtreme , you might e ven include section title s in y our mark up
for acce ssibility r easons but complet ely hide them visually because the
content spe aks for itself .
Don’t let the element y ou’re using influence ho w you choose to style it —
pick elements f or semantic purpose s and style them ho wever you need to
create the be st visual hier archy.Separ ate visual hier archy from document hier archy 47Balance w eight and contr ast
The r eason bold te xt feels emphasiz ed compar ed to r egular te xt is that bold
text co vers mor e sur face ar ea — in the same amount of space , mor e pix els
are used f or te xt than f or the back ground.
So wh y is this inter esting? W ell it turns out that the r elationship betw een
surface ar ea and hier archy has implications on other elements in a UI as w ell.
Using contr ast to compensa te for w eight
One of the place s under standing this r elationship become s impor tant is
when w orking with icons.
Just lik e bold te xt, icons (especially solid one s)are gener ally pr etty “he avy”
and co ver a lot of sur face ar ea. As a r esult, when y ou put an icon ne xt to
some te xt, the icon tends to f eel emphasiz ed.Unlike text, ther e’s no w ay to change the “ weight” of an icon, so to cr eate
balance it needs to be de-emphasiz ed in some other w ay.
A simple and eff ectiv e way to do this is to lo wer the contr ast of the icon b y
giving it a sof ter color .
Balance w eight and contr ast 49This w orks anywher e you need to balance elements that ha ve diff erent
weights. R educing the contr ast w orks like a counterbalance , making he avier
elements f eel lighter e ven though the w eight hasn ’t changed.
Using w eight to compensa te for contr ast
Just lik e ho w reducing contr ast helps to de-emphasiz e he avy elements,
increasing w eight is a gr eat way to add a bit of emphasis to lo w contr ast
elements.
This is useful when things lik e thin 1p x bor ders are too subtle using a sof t
color , but dark ening the color mak es the de sign f eel har sh and nois y.
Balance w eight and contr ast 50Making the bor der a bit he avier b y incr easing the width helps to emphasiz e
it without losing the sof ter look:
Balance w eight and contr ast 51Semantic s ar e secondar y
When ther e are multiple actions a user can t ake on a page , it’s easy to f all
into the tr ap of de signing those actions based pur ely on semantics.
Semantics ar e an impor tant par t of button de sign, but that doe sn’t me an you
can f orget about hier archy.
Every action on a page sits some wher e in a p yramid of impor tance . Most
page s only ha ve one true primar y action, a couple of le ss impor tant
secondar y actions, and a f ew seldom used ter tiary actions.
When de signing the se actions, it’ s impor tant to communicate their place in
the hier archy.
•Primar y actions should be ob vious. Solid, high contr ast back ground
color s work gr eat her e.•Secondar y actions should be cle ar but not pr ominent. Outline style s or
lower contr ast back ground color s are great options.
•Tertiary actions should be dis coverable but unobtrusiv e.Styling the se
actions lik e link s is usually the be st appr oach.
When y ou take a hier archy-first appr oach to de signing the actions on page ,
the r esult is a much le ss bus y UI that communicate s mor e cle arly:
Semantics ar e secondar y 53Destructiv e actions
Being de structiv e or high se verity doe sn’t automatically me an a button
should be big, r ed, and bold.
If a de structiv e action isn ’t the primar y action on the page , it might be better
to giv e it a secondar y or ter tiary button tr eatment.
Combine this with a confirmation step wher e the de structiv e action actually
is the primar y action, and apply the big, r ed, bold styling ther e.
Semantics ar e secondar y 54Layout and SpacingStart with too much white space
One of the e asiest ways to cle an up a de sign is to simply giv e every element
a little mor e room to br eathe .
Sounds simple enough, right? So ho w come w e don ’t usually do it?White space should be r emo ved, not added
When de signing f or the w eb, white space is almost alw aysadded to a de sign
— if something look s little too cr amped, y ou add a bit of mar gin or padding
until things look better .
The pr oblem with this appr oach is that elements ar e only giv en the minimum
amount of br eathing r oom nece ssary to not look activ ely bad . To mak e
something actually look great, you usually need mor e white space .Start with too much white space 57A better appr oach is to st art by giving something way too m uch space , then
remo ve it until y ou’re happ y with the r esult.
Start with too much white space 58You might think y ou’d end up with too much white space this w ay, but in
practice , what might seem lik e “a little too much ” when f ocused on an
individual element ends up being closer to “ just enough ” in the conte xt of a
complete UI.
Dens e UIs ha ve their place
While inter faces with a lot of br eathing r oom almost alw ays feel cle aner and
simpler , ther e are cer tainly situations wher e it mak es sense f or a de sign to be
much mor e compact.
For example , if you’re de signing some sor t of dashboar d wher e a lot of
information needs to be visible at once , packing that inf ormation together so
it all fits on one scr een might be w orth making the de sign f eel mor e bus y.
The impor tant thing is to mak e this a deliber ate decision inste ad of just
being the def ault. It’ s a lot mor e ob vious when y ou need to r emo ve white
space than it is when y ou need to add it.Start with too much white space 59Establish a spacing and sizing
system
You shouldn ’t be nitpicking betw een 12 0px and 125p x when tr ying to decide
on the per fect siz e for an element in y our UI.
Painfully trialing arbitr ary values one pix el at a time will dr astically slo w you
down at be st, and cr eate ugly , inconsistent de signs at w orst.
Inste ad, limit y ourself to a constr ained set of v alues, defined in adv ance .A line ar s cale w on’t work
Creating a spacing and sizing s ystem isn ’t quite as simple as something lik e
“make sure everything is a m ultiple o f 4px”— a naiv e appr oach lik e that
doesn’t mak e it an y easier to choose betw een 12 0px and 125p x.
For a s ystem to be truly useful, it needs to t ake into consider ation the relative
difference betw een adjacent v alues.
At the small end of the scale (like the siz e of an icon, or the padding inside a
button), a couple of pix els can mak e a big diff erence . Jumping fr om 12p x to
16px is an incr ease of 3 3%!
But at the lar ge end (the width o f a card, or the v ertical spacing in a landing
page her o), a couple of pix els is basically imper ceivable. Even incr easing the
width of a car d from 5 00px to 52 0px is only a diff erence of 4 %, which is
eight time sless significant than the jump fr om 12p x to 16p x.Establish a spacing and sizing s ystem 61If you w ant y our s ystem to mak e sizing decisions e asy, mak e sur e no tw o
values in y our scale ar e ever closer than about 25 %.
Defining the s ystem
Just lik e you don ’t want to toil o ver arbitr ary values when sizing an element
or fine-tuning the space betw een elements, y ou don ’t want to build y our
spacing and sizing scale fr om arbitr ary values either .
A simple appr oach is to st art with a sensible basevalue, then build a scale
using f actor s and multiple s of that v alue.
16px is a gr eat number to st art with because it divide s nicely , and also
happens to be the def ault f ont siz e in e very major w eb br owser .Establish a spacing and sizing s ystem 62The v alues at the small end of the scale should st art pretty pack ed together ,
and get pr ogressively mor e spaced apar t as y ou get fur ther up the scale .
Here’s an e xample of a f airly pr actical scale built using this appr oach:
Using the s ystem
Once y ou’ve defined y our spacing and sizing s ystem, y ou’ll find that y ou’re
able to de sign a hell of a lot f aster , especially if y ou de sign in the br owser
(sticking t o a s ystem is e asier when y ou’re typing in n umbers than when
you’re dragging with the mouse .)Establish a spacing and sizing s ystem 63Need to add some space under an element? Gr ab a v alue fr om y our scale
and tr y it out. Not quite enough ? The ne xt value is pr obably per fect.
While the w orkflo w impr ovements ar e probably the bigge st benefit, y ou’ll
also st art to notice a subtle consistenc y in y our de signs that w asn’t ther e
before, and things will look just a little bit cle aner .
A spacing and sizing s ystem will help y ou cr eate better de signs, with le ss
effort, in le ss time . Design advice doe sn’t get much mor e valuable than that.Establish a spacing and sizing s ystem 64You don ’t ha ve to fill the whole
screen
Remember when 96 0px was the de f acto la yout width f or de sktop-siz e
designs ? The se da ys you’d be har d-pressed to find a phone with a r esolution
that lo w.
So it’ s no surprise that when most of us open our de sign tool of choice on
our high r esolution displa ys, w e giv e our selvesat least1200-1400px of space
to fill. But just because y ou ha ve the space , doe sn’t me an you need to use it.
If you only need 6 00px, use 6 00px. Spr eading things out or making things
unnece ssarily wide just mak es an inter face har der to interpr et, while a little
extra space ar ound the edge s never hur t anyone.This is just as applicable to individual sections of an inter face, too . You don ’t
need to mak eeverything full-width just because something else (lik e your
navigation) is full-width.
You don ’t have to fill the whole scr een 66Give each element just the space it needs — don ’t mak e something w orse
just to mak e it match something else .
Shrink the c anvas
If you’re having a har d time de signing a small inter face on a lar ge can vas,
shrink the can vas! A lot of the time it’ s easier to de sign something small
when the constr aints ar e real.
If you’re building a r esponsiv e web application, tr y starting with a ~4 00px
canvas and de signing the mobile la yout fir st.
You don ’t have to fill the whole scr een 67Once y ou ha ve a mobile de sign y ou’re happ y with, bring it o ver to a lar ger
size scr een and adjust an ything that f elt lik e a compr omise on smaller
screens. Odds ar e you w on’t have to change as much as y ou think.
Thinking in columns
If you’re de signing something that w orks best at a narr ower width but f eels
unbalanced in the conte xt of an other wise wide UI, see if y ou can split it into
columns inste ad of just making it wider .You don ’t have to fill the whole scr een 68For example , take this narr ow form la yout:
You don ’t have to fill the whole scr een 69If you w anted to mak e better use of the a vailable space without making the
form har der to use , you could br eak the suppor ting te xt out into a separ ate
column:
This mak es the de sign f eel mor e balanced and consistent without
compr omising on the optimal width f or the f orm itself .You don ’t have to fill the whole scr een 70Don ’t force it
Just lik e you shouldn ’t worry about filling the whole scr een, y ou shouldn ’t try
to cr am e verything into a small ar ea unnece ssarily either .
If you need a lot of space , go f or it! Just don ’t feel obligated to fill it if y ou
don’t have to.You don ’t have to fill the whole scr een 71Grids ar e overrated
Using a s ystem lik e a 12 -column grid is a gr eat way to simplif y layout
decisions, and can bring a satisf ying sense of or der to y our de signs.
But e ven though grids can be useful, outsour cing allof your la yout decisions
to a grid can do mor e harm than good.
Not all element s should be fluid
Fundament ally, a grid s ystem is just about giving elements fluid, per cent age-
based widths, wher e you’re choosing fr om a constr ained set of per cent ages.
For example , in a 12 -column grid e ach column is 8 .33% wide . As long as anelement’ s width is some multiple of 8 .33%(including an y gutt ers), that
element is “ on the grid” .
The pr oblem with tr eating grid s ystems lik e a r eligion is that ther e are a lot of
situations wher e it mak es much mor e sense f or an element to ha ve afixed
width inste ad of a r elativ e width.
For example , consider a tr aditional sidebar la yout. U sing a 12 -column grid
system, y ou might giv e the sidebar a width of thr ee columns ( 25%) and the
main content ar ea a width of nine columns ( 75%).
Grids ar e overrated 73This might seem fine at fir st, but think about what happens when y ou resize
the scr een.
If you mak e the scr een wider the sidebar gets wider too , taking up space
that could’ ve been put to better use b y the main content ar ea.
Similarly , if you mak e the scr een narr ower, the sidebar can shrink belo w its
minimum r easonable width, causing a wkw ard text wr apping or truncation.
In this situation, it mak es much mor e sense to giv e the sidebar a fix ed width
that’ s optimiz ed for its contents. The main content ar ea can then fle x to fill
the r emaining space , using its o wninternal grid to la y out its childr en.Grids ar e overrated 74This applie s within components, too — don ’t use per cent ages to siz e
something unle ss you actually w ant it to scale .
Grids ar e overrated 75Don ’t shrink an element until y ou need to
Say you’re de signing a login car d. Using the full scr een width w ould look
ugly, so y ou giv e it a width of 6 columns ( 50%) with a 3-column off set on
each side .
On medium-siz ed scr eens y ou realize the car d is a little narr ow even though
you ha ve the space to mak e it bigger , so at that scr een siz e you switch it to a
width of 8 columns, with tw o empty columns on e ach side .
Grids ar e overrated 76The silly thing about this appr oach is that because column widths ar e fluid,
there’s a range in scr een siz es wher e the login car d iswider on medium
screens than it is on lar ge scr eens:
If you kno w that sa y 500px is the optimal siz e for the car d, wh y should it
ever get smaller than that if y ou ha ve the space f or it?
Inste ad of sizing elements lik e this based on a grid, giv e them a max -width
so the y don ’t get too lar ge, and only f orce them to shrink when the scr een
gets smaller than that max -width.Grids ar e overrated 77Don’t be a sla ve to the grid — giv e your components the space the y need
and don ’t mak e any compr omise s until it’ s actually nece ssary.Grids ar e overrated 78Relative sizing doe sn’t scale
It’s tempting to belie ve that e very par t of an inter face should be siz ed
relativ e to one another , and that if element A needs to shrink b y 25% on
smaller scr eens, that element B should shrink b y 25%, too .
For example , say you’re de signing an ar ticle at a lar ge scr een siz e. If your
body cop y is 18p x and y our he adline s are 45p x, it’s tempting to encode that
relationship b y defining y our he adline siz e as 2.5em ; 2.5 time s the curr ent
font siz e.
Ther e’s nothing inher ently wr ong with using r elativ e units lik eem, but don ’t
be fooled into belie ving that r elationships defined this w ay can r emain st atic
— 2.5em might be the per fect he adline siz e on de sktop but ther e’s no
guar antee that it’ll be the right siz e on smaller scr eens.Say you reduce the siz e of y our body cop y to 1 4px on small scr eens to k eep
the line length in check. K eeping y our he adline s at 2 .5em me ans a r ender ed
font siz e of 35p x — w ay too big f or a small scr een!
A better he adline siz e for small scr eens might be some wher e betw een 2 0px
and 2 4px:
Relativ e sizing doe sn’t scale 80That’ s only 1 .5-1.7x the siz e of the 1 4px body cop y — a tot ally diff erent
relationship than what made sense on de sktop scr eens. That me ans ther e
isn’t any real relationship at all, and that ther e’s no r eal benefit in tr ying to
define the he adline siz e relativ e to the body cop y siz e.
As a gener al rule , elements that ar e lar ge on lar ge scr eens need to shrink
fasterthan elements that ar e alr eady f airly small — the diff erence betw een
small elements and lar ge elements should be le ss extreme at small scr een
sizes.
Relationship s within element s
The ide a that things should scale independently doe sn’t just apply to sizing
elements at diff erent scr een siz es; it applie s to the pr oper ties of a single
component, too .
Say you’ve de signed a button. It’ s got a 16p x font siz e, 16p x of horiz ontal
padding, and 12p x of v ertical padding:
Much lik e the pr evious e xample , it’s tempting to think that the padding
should be defined in terms of the curr ent f ont siz e. That w ay if y ou w ant a
larger or smaller button, y ou only need to change the f ont siz e and the
padding will update automatically , right?Relativ e sizing doe sn’t scale 81This w orks — the buttons doscale up or do wn and pr eserve the same
propor tions. But is that what w e really w ant?
Compar e that to the se buttons, wher e the padding gets mor e gener ous at
larger siz es and dispr opor tionately tighter at smaller siz es:
Here the lar ge button actually feels like a lar ger button, and the small
buttons actually f eel lik e smaller buttons, not lik e we simply adjusted the
zoom.
Let go of the ide a that e verything needs to scale pr opor tionately — giving
yourself the fr eedom to fine-tune things independently mak es it a hell of a
lot e asier to de sign f or multiple conte xts.Relativ e sizing doe sn’t scale 82Avoid ambiguous spacing
When gr oups of elements ar e explicitly separ ated — usually b y a bor der or
back ground color — it’ s obvious which elements belong to which gr oup.
But when ther e isn ’t a visible separ ator, it’s not alw ays so ob vious.
Say you’re de signing a f orm with st acked labels and inputs. If the mar gin
belo w the label is the same as the mar gin belo w the input, the elements in
the f orm gr oup w on’t feel ob viously “ connected” .At best the user has to w ork har der to interpr et the UI, and at w orst it me ans
accident ally putting the wr ong dat a in the wr ong field.
The fix is to incr ease the space betw een e ach f orm gr oup so it’ s cle ar which
label belongs to which input:
Avoid ambiguous spacing 84This same pr oblem sho ws up in ar ticle de sign when ther e’s not enough
space abo ve section he adings:
…and in bulleted lists, when the space betw een bullets matche s the line-
height of a single bullet:
Avoid ambiguous spacing 85It’s not just v ertical spacing that y ou ha ve to w orry about either ; it’s easy to
make this mist ake with components that ar e laid out horiz ontally, too:
Whene ver you’re relying on spacing to connect a gr oup of elements, alw ays
make sur e ther e’s mor e space around the gr oup than ther e is within it —
inter faces that ar e har d to under stand alw ays look w orse.Avoid ambiguous spacing 86Designing T extEstablish a type s cale
Most inter faces use w ay too man y font siz es. Unless a te am has a rigid
design s ystem in place , it’s not uncommon to find that e very pix el value fr om
10px to 2 4px has been used in the UI some wher e.
Choosing f ont siz es without a s ystem is a bad ide a for tw o reasons:
1.It leads to anno ying inconsistencie s in y our de signs.
2.It slo ws do wn y our w orkflo w.
So ho w do y ou define a type s ystem ?Choo sing a s cale
Just lik e with spacing and sizing, a line ar scale w on’t work. Smaller jumps
betw een f ont siz es are useful at the bottom of the scale , but y ou don ’t want
to w aste time deciding betw een 46p x and 48p x for a lar ge he adline .
Modular s cales
One appr oach is to calculate y our type scale using a ratio, like 4:5 (a “major
third”), 2:3(a “perfect fif th”), or perhaps the “ golden r atio”, 1:1.618. This is
often called a “ modular scale ”.
You st art with a sensible base v alue (16px is common since it ’s the de fault
font siz e for mo st br owsers) , apply y our r atio to get the ne xt value, then
apply y our r atio to thatvalue to get the ne xt value, and so on and so f orth:
Establish a type scale 89The mathematical purity of this appr oach is alluring, but in pr actice , it’s not
perfect f or a couple of r easons.
1.You end up with fr actional v alue s.
Using a 16p x base and 4:5 r atio, your scale will end up with lots of siz es
that don ’t land right on the pix el, lik e 31.25p x, 39 .063p x, 48 .828px, etc .
Browser s all handle subpix el rounding a little bit diff erently , so it’ s best to
avoid fr actional siz es if y ou can a void it.
If you do w ant to use this appr oach, mak e sur e you round the v alues
yourself when defining the scale to a void off -by-one pix el issue s acr oss
browser s.
2.You usually need mor e siz es.
This appr oach can w ork w ell if y ou’re defining a type scale f or long f orm
content lik e an ar ticle , but f or inter face de sign, the jumps y ou get using
a modular scale ar e often a bit toolimiting.
With a (rounded) 3:4 type scale , you get siz es like 12p x, 16p x, 21p x, and
28px. While this might not seem too limiting on the sur face, in pr actice
you’re going to wish y ou had a siz e betw een 12p x and 16p x, and another
betw een 16p x and 21p x.
You could use a tighter r atio lik e 8:9, but at this point y ou’re just tr ying to
pick a scale that happens to match the siz es you alr eady kno w you w ant.
Hand-cr afted s cales
For inter face de sign, a mor e practical appr oach is to simply pick v alues by
hand. Y ou don ’t have to w orry about subpix el rounding err ors this w ay, and
you ha ve tot al contr ol over which siz es exist inste ad of outsour cing that job
to some mathematical f ormula.Establish a type scale 90Here’s an e xample of a scale that w orks well for most pr ojects and aligns
nicely with the spacing and sizing scale r ecommended in “Establishing a
spacing and sizing s ystem”:
It’s constr ained just enough to speed up y our decision making, but isn ’t so
limited as to mak e you feel lik e you’re missing a useful siz e.Establish a type scale 91Avoid em unit s
When y ou’re building a type scale , don ’t use emunits to define y our siz es.
Because emunits ar e relativ e to the curr ent f ont siz e, the computed f ont siz e
of ne sted elements is of ten not actually a v alue in y our scale .
For example , say you’ve defined an em-based type scale lik e this:
Establish a type scale 92If you giv e an element a f ont siz e of 1 .25em (20px by default), inside of that
element 1em is no w equal to 2 0px. That me ans that if y ou giv e one of the
nestedelements a f ont siz e of . 875em, the actual computed f ont siz e is
17.5px, not a v alue fr om y our type scale!
Stick to pxorremunits — it’ s the only w ay to guar antee y ou’re actually
sticking to the s ystem.Establish a type scale 93Use good f onts
With thousands of diff erent typef aces out ther e to choose fr om, separ ating
the good fr om the bad can be an intimidating t ask.
Developing an e ye for all of the det ails that mak e a good typef ace can t ake
years. You pr obably don ’t have years, so her e are a few trick s you can use to
start picking out high quality typef aces right a way.
Play it saf e
For UI de sign, y our saf est bet is a f airly neutr al sans-serif — think something
like Helv etica.
If you really don ’t trust y our o wn t aste, one gr eat option is to r ely on the
system f ont st ack:
-apple-system, Segoe UI, Roboto, Noto Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, Helvetica Neue;It might not be the most ambitious choice , but at le ast y our user s will
already be used to seeing it.
Ignor e typef ace s with le ss than fiv e weight s
This isn ’talwa ystrue, but as a gener al rule , typef aces that come in a lot of
different w eights tend to be cr afted with mor e car e and attention to det ail
than typef aces with f ewer w eights.
Many font dir ectorie s(like Google F onts) will let y ou filter b y “number of
style s”, which is a combination of the a vailable w eights as w ell as the it alic
variations of those w eights.
A great way to limit the number of options y ou ha ve to choose fr om is to
crank that up to 10+ (to account f or italics):
Use good f onts 95On Google F onts specifically , that cuts out 85 % of the a vailable options,
leaving y ou with le ss than 5 0 sans-serif s to choose fr om.
Optimiz e for legibility
When someone de signs a f ont f amily , the y are usually de signing it f or a
specific purpose . Fonts me ant f or he adline s usually ha ve tighter letter -
spacing and shor ter lo wercase letter s(a shor ter x-height) , while f onts me ant
for smaller siz es have wider letter -spacing and t aller lo wercase letter s.
Keep this in mind and a void using condensed typef aces with shor t x-heights
for your main UI te xt.
Trust the wis dom of the cr owd
If a f ont is popular , it’s probably a good f ont. Most f ont dir ectorie s will let y ou
sort by popularity , so this can be a gr eat way to limit y our choice s.
This is e specially useful when y ou’re trying to pick out something other than
a neutr al UI typef ace. Picking a nice serif with some per sonality f or example
can be tough.Use good f onts 96Leveraging the collectiv e decision-making po wer of thousands of other
people can mak e it a lot e asier .
Steal fr om people who c are
Inspect some of y our f avorite site s and see what typef aces the y are using.
Use good f onts 97Ther e are a lot of gr eat de sign te ams out ther e full of people with really
strong opinions about typogr aphy, and the y’ll often choose gr eat fonts that
you might ha ve ne ver found using some of the saf er appr oache s outlined
above.
Developing y our intuition
Once y ou st art paying closer attention to the typogr aphy on w ell-de signed
sites, it’s not long bef ore you feel pr etty comf ortable labeling a typef ace as
awesome or terrible .
You’re gonna be a type snob soon enough, but the advice outlined abo ve will
help get y ou b y in the me antime .Use good f onts 98Keep y our line length in check
When styling par agraphs, it’ s easy to mak e the mist ake of fitting the te xt to
your la yout inste ad of tr ying to cr eate the be st reading e xperience .
Usually this me ans line s that ar e too long, making te xt har der to r ead.
For the be st reading e xperience , mak e your par agraphs wide enough to fit
betw een 45 and 75 char acter s per line . The e asiest way to do this on the
web is using emunits, which ar e relativ e to the curr ent f ont siz e. A width of
20-35em will get y ou in the right ballpark.
Going a bit wider than 75 char acter s per line can sometime s work too , but
be a ware that y ou’re entering risky territor y — stick to the 45- 75 range if y ou
want to pla y it saf e.
Dealing with wider content
If you’re mixing par agraph te xt with image s or other lar ge components, y ou
should still limit the par agraph width e ven if the o verall content ar ea needs
to be wider to accommodate the other elements.
Keep y our line length in check 100It might seem counterintuitiv e at fir st to use diff erent widths in the same
content ar ea, but the r esult almost alw ays look s mor e polished.Keep y our line length in check 101Bas eline , not center
Ther e are a lot of situations wher e it mak es sense to use multiple f ont siz es
to cr eate hier archy on a single line .
For example , maybe y ou’re de signing a car d that has a lar ge title in the top
left and a smaller list of actions in the top right.
When y ou’re mixing f ont siz es like this, y our instinct might be to v ertically
center the te xt for balance:
When ther e’s a decent amount of space betw een the diff erent f ont siz es it
often w on’t look bad enough to catch y our attention, but when the te xt is
close together the a wkw ard alignment become s mor e ob vious:
A better appr oach is to align mix ed font siz es by their baseline , which is the
imaginar y line that letter s rest on:
Baseline , not center 103When y ou align mix ed font siz es by their baseline , you’re taking adv antage of
an alignment r eference that y our e yes already per ceive.
The r esult is a simpler , cleaner look than what y ou get when y ou center tw o
piece s of te xt and off set their baseline s.Baseline , not center 104Line-height is pr opor tional
You might ha ve he ard the advice that a line-height of about 1 .5 is a good
starting point fr om a r eadability per spectiv e.
While that’ s not nece ssarily untrue , choosing the right line-height f or your
text is a bit mor e complicated than just using the same v alue acr oss the
boar d in all situations.
Accounting f or line length
The r eason w e add space betw een line s of te xt is to mak e it e asy for the
reader to find the ne xt line when the te xt wr aps. Ha ve you e ver accident ally
read the same line of te xt twice , or accident ally skipped a line ? The line-
height w as pr obably too shor t.When line s of te xt ar e spaced too tightly , it’s easy to finish r eading a line of
text at the right edge of a page then jump y our e yes all the w ay back to the
left edge only to be unsur e which line is ne xt.
This pr oblem is magnified when line s of te xt ar e long. The fur ther y our e yes
have to jump horiz ontally to r ead the ne xt line , the e asier it is to lose y our
place .
That me ans that y our line-height and par agraph width should be
propor tional — narr ow content can use a shor ter line-height lik e 1.5, but wide
content might need a line-height as t all as 2 .
Line-height is pr opor tional 106Accounting f or font siz e
Line length isn ’t the only f actor in choosing the right line-height — f ont siz e
has a big impact as w ell.
When te xt is small, e xtra line spacing is impor tant because it mak es it a lot
easier f or your e yes to find the ne xt line when the te xt wr aps.
But as te xt gets lar ger, your e yes don ’t need as much help . This me ans that
for lar ge he adline te xt you might not need an y extra line spacing, and a line-
height of 1 is per fectly fine .Line-height is pr opor tional 107Line-height and f ont siz e areinversely propor tional — use a t aller line-height
for small te xt and a shor ter line-height f or lar ge te xt.Line-height is pr opor tional 108Not e very link needs a color
When y ou’re including a link in a block of other wise non-link te xt, it’ s
impor tant to mak e sur e that the link st ands out and look s click able.
But when y ou’re de signing an inter face wher e almost e verything is a link,
using a tr eatment de signed to mak e link s “pop” in par agraph te xt can be
really o verbe aring.
Inste ad, emphasiz e most link s in a mor e subtle w ay, like by just using a
heavier f ont w eight or dark er color .
Some link s might not e ven need to be emphasiz ed b y def ault at all. If y ou’ve
got link s in y our inter face that ar e really ancillar y and not par t of the main
path a user t akes thr ough the application, consider adding an underline or
changing the color only on ho ver.
They’ll still be disco verable to an y user s who think to tr y, but w on’t compete
for attention with mor e impor tant actions on the page .Not e very link needs a color 110Align with r eadability in mind
In gener al, te xt should be aligned to match the dir ection of the language it’ s
written in. F or English (and most other language s), that me ans that the v ast
majority of te xt should be lef t-aligned.
Other alignment options do ha ve their place though, y ou just need to use
them eff ectiv ely.
Don ’t center long f orm te xt
Center -alignment can look gr eat for he adline s or shor t, independent block s
of te xt.
But if something is longer than tw o or thr ee line s, it will almost alw ays look
better lef t-aligned.
If you’ve got a f ew block s of te xt you w ant to center but one of them is a bit
too long, the e asiest fix is to r ewrite the content and mak e it shor ter:
Not only will it fix the alignment issue , it will mak e your de sign f eel mor e
consistent, too .Align with r eadability in mind 112Right-align number s
If you’re de signing a t able that include s number s, right-align them.
When the decimal in a list of number s is alw ays in the same place , the y’re a
lot e asier to compar e at a glance .
Hyphena te justified te xt
Justified te xt look s great in print and can w ork w ell on the w eb when y ou’re
going f or a mor e formal look, but without special car e, it can cr eate a lot of
awkw ard gaps betw een w ords:
Align with r eadability in mind 113To avoid this, whene ver you justif y text, you should also enable h yphenation:
Justified te xt works best in situations wher e you’re trying to mimic a print
look, perhaps f or an online magazine or ne wspaper . Even then, lef t aligned
text works great too , so it’ s really just a matter of pr eference .Align with r eadability in mind 114Use letter -spacing eff ectiv ely
When styling te xt, a lot of eff ort is put into getting the w eight, color , and line-
height just right, but it’ s easy to f orget that letter -spacing can be tw eaked,
too.
As a gener al rule , you should trust the typef ace de signer and le ave letter -
spacing alone . That said, ther e are a couple of common situations wher e
adjusting it can impr ove your de signs.Tightening he adline s
When someone de signs a f ont f amily , the y de sign it with a purpose in mind.
A family lik e Open Sans is de signed to be highly legible e ven at small siz es,
so the built-in letter -spacing is a lot wider than a f amily lik e Os wald which is
designed f or he adline s.
If you w ant to use a f amily with wider letter -spacing f or he adline s or title s, it
can of ten mak e sense to decr ease the letter -spacing to mimic the
condensed look of a purpose-built he adline f amily :
Avoid tr ying to mak e this w ork the other w ay around though — he adline
fonts r arely w ork w ell at small siz es even if y ou incr ease the letter spacing.Use letter -spacing eff ectiv ely 116Impr oving all-c aps legibility
The letter -spacing in most f ont f amilie s is optimiz ed for normal “ sentence
case ” text — a capit al letter f ollowed b y mostly lo wercase letter s.
Lowercase letter s have a lot of v ariety visually . Letter s liken,v, and efit
entir ely within a typef ace’s x-height, other letter s likey,g, and phave
descenders that pok e out belo w the baseline , and letter s likeb,f, and thave
ascenders that e xtend abo ve.
All-caps te xt on the other hand isn ’t so div erse. Since e very letter is the same
height, using the def ault letter -spacing of ten le ads to te xt that is har der to
read because ther e are fewer distinguishing char acteristics betw een letter s.
For that r eason, it of ten mak es sense to incr ease the letter -spacing of all-
caps te xt to impr ove readability :
Use letter -spacing eff ectiv ely 117Working with C olorDitch he x for HSL
Hex and R GB ar e the most common f ormats f or representing color on the
web, but the y’re not the most useful.
Using he x or R GB, color s that ha ve a lot in common visually look nothing
alike in code .
HSL fix es this b y representing color s using attribute s the human-e ye
intuitiv ely per ceives:hue,saturation, and lightne ss.
Hueis a color ’s position on the color wheel — it’ s the attribute of a color that
lets us identif y two color s as “blue ” even if the y aren’t identical.
Hue is me asured in degr ees, wher e 0° is r ed, 12 0° is gr een, and 2 40° is blue .
Saturation is ho w color ful or vivid a color look s. 0% satur ation is gr ey (no
color), and 100% satur ation is vibr ant and intense .
Without satur ation, hue is irr elevant — r otating the hue when satur ation is
0% doe sn’t actually change the color at all.
Ditch he x for HSL 120Lightne ssis just what it sounds lik e — it me asures how close a color is to
black or to white . 0% lightne ss is pur e black, 100% lightne ss is pur e white ,
and 5 0% lightne ss is a pur e color at the giv en hue .
HSL v s. HSB
Don’t confuse HSL f or HSB — lightne ssin HSL is not the same as brightne ss
in HSB.
In HSB, 0% brightne ss is alw ays black, but 100% brightne ss is only white
when the satur ation is 0%. When satur ation is 100%, 100% brightne ss in HSB
is the same as 100% satur ation and 50%lightne ss in HSL .
Ditch he x for HSL 121HSB is mor e common than HSL in de sign sof tware, but br owser s only
under stand HSL , so if y ou’re de signing f or the w eb, HSL should be y our
weapon of choice .Ditch he x for HSL 122You need mor e color s than y ou
think
Ever used one of those color palette gener ators wher e you pick a st arting
color , tweak some options, and ar e then be stowed the fiv e per fect color s
you should use to build y our w ebsite ?
This calculated appr oach to picking the per fect color scheme is e xtremely
seductiv e, but it’ s not v ery useful unle ss you w ant y our site to look lik e this:
Wha t you actually need
You can ’t build an ything with fiv e hex code s. To build something r eal, you
need a much mor e compr ehensiv e set of color s to choose fr om.
You can br eak a good color palette do wn into thr ee categorie s.
Greys
Text, back grounds, panels, f orm contr ols — almost e verything in an inter face
is gr ey.You need mor e color s than y ou think 124You’ll need mor e greys than y ou think, too — thr ee or f our shade s might
sound lik e plenty but it w on’t be long bef ore you wish y ou had something a
little dark er than shade # 2 but a little lighter than shade #3 .
In pr actice , you w ant 8- 10 shade s to choose fr om (mor e on this in “ Define
your shade s up fr ont”). Not so man y that y ou w aste time deciding betw een
shade #77 and shade #7 8, but enough to mak e sur e you don ’t have to
compr omise too much.
True black tends to look pr etty unnatur al, so st art with a r eally dark gr ey and
work y our w ay up to white in ste ady incr ements.You need mor e color s than y ou think 125Primar y color( s)
Most site s need one ,maybetwo color s that ar e used f or primar y actions,
activ e navigation elements, etc . The se ar e the color s that determine the
overall look of a site — the one s that mak e you think of F acebook as “blue ”.
Just lik e with gr eys, y ou need a v ariety (5-10)of lighter and dark er shade s to
choose fr om.
Ultra-light shade s can be useful as a tinted back ground f or things lik e aler ts,
while dark er shade s work gr eat for te xt.
Accent color s
On top of primar y color s, every site needs a f ewaccent color s for
communicating diff erent things to the user .
For example , you might w ant to use an e ye-grabbing color lik e yellow, pink,
or te al to highlight a ne w feature:
You need mor e color s than y ou think 126You might also need color s to emphasiz e diff erent semantic states, like red
for confirming a de structiv e action:
…yellow for a w arning me ssage:
…or gr een to highlight a positiv e trend:
You need mor e color s than y ou think 127You’ll w ant multiple shade s for the se color s too , even though the y should be
used pr etty sparingly thr oughout the UI.
If you’re building something wher e you need to use color to distinguish or
categoriz e similar elements (lik e line s on gr aphs, e vents in a calendar , or
tags on a pr oject), y ou might need e ven mor e accent color s.
All in, it’ s not uncommon to need as man y as tendifferent color s with 5-10
shade s eachfor a comple x UI.You need mor e color s than y ou think 128Define y our shade s up fr ont
When y ou need to cr eate a lighter or dark er variation of a color in y our
palette , don ’t get cle ver using CS S preprocessor functions lik e “lighten ” or
“dark en” to cr eate shade s on the fly . That’ s how you end up with 35 slightly
different blue s that all look the same .
Inste ad, define a fix ed set of shade s up fr ont that y ou can choose fr om as
you w ork.
So ho w do y ou put together a palette lik e this an yways?
Choo se the bas e color fir st
Start by picking a basecolor f or the scale y ou w ant to cr eate — the color in
the middle that y our lighter and dark er shade s are based on.Ther e’s no r eal scientific w ay to do this, but f or primar y and accent color s, a
good rule of thumb is to pick a shade that w ould w ork w ell as a button
back ground.
It’s impor tant to note that ther e are no r eal rule s her e like “start at 5 0%
lightne ss” or an ything — e very color beha ves a bit diff erently , so y ou’ll ha ve
to rely on y our e yes for this one .
Finding the edge s
Next, pick y our dark est shade and y our lighte st shade . Ther e’s no r eal
science to this either , but it helps to think about wher e the y will be used and
choose them using that conte xt.
The dark est shade of a color is usually r eserved for te xt, while the lighte st
shade might be used to tint the back ground of an element.
A simple aler t component is a good e xample that combine s both of the se
use case s, so it can be a gr eat place to pick the se color s.
Define y our shade s up fr ont 130Start with a color that matche s the hue of y our base color , and adjust the
satur ation and lightne ss until y ou’re satisfied.
Filling in the gap s
Once y ou’ve got y our base , dark est, and lighte st shade s, you just need to fill
in the gaps in betw een them.
For most pr ojects, y ou’ll need at le ast 5 shade s per color , and pr obably
closer to 10 if y ou don ’t want to f eel too constr ained.
Nine is a gr eat number because it’ s easy to divide and mak es filling in the
gaps a little mor e str aight forward. Let’s call our dark est shade 900, our base
shade 500, and our lighte st shade 100.
Start by picking shade s700and 300, the one s right in the middle of the
gaps. Y ou w ant the se shade s to f eel lik e the per fect compr omise betw een
the shade s on either side .
This cr eates four mor e hole s in the scale ( 800,600,400, and 200), which
you can fill using the same appr oach.
Define y our shade s up fr ont 131You should end up with a pr etty balanced set of color s that pr ovide just
enough options to accommodate y our de sign ide as without f eeling limiting.
Wha t about gr eys?
With gr eys the base color isn ’t as impor tant, but other wise the pr ocess is the
same . Start at the edge s and fill in the gaps until y ou ha ve what y ou need.
Pick y our dark est gr ey by choosing a color f or the dark est te xt in y our
project, and y our lighte st gr ey by choosing something that w orks well for a
subtle off -white back ground.
It’s not a s cience
As tempting as it is, y ou can ’t rely pur ely on math to cr aft the per fect color
palette .
A systematic appr oach lik e the one de scribed abo ve is gr eat to get y ou
started, but don ’t be afr aid to mak e little tw eaks if y ou need to .
Once y ou actually st art using y our color s in y our de signs, it’ s almost
inevitable that y ou’ll w ant to tw eak the satur ation on a shade , or mak e a
couple of shade s lighter or dark er. Trust y our e yes, not the number s.
Just tr y to a void adding newshade s too of ten if y ou can a void it. If y ou’re not
diligent about limiting y our palette , you might as w ell ha ve no color s ystem
at all.Define y our shade s up fr ont 132Don ’t let lightne ss kill y our
saturation
In the HSL color space , as a color gets closer to 0% or 100% lightne ss, the
impact of satur ation is w eakened — the same satur ation v alue at 5 0%
lightne ss look s mor e color ful than it doe s at 90% lightne ss.
That me ans that if y ou don ’t want the lighter and dark er shade s of a giv en
color to look w ashed out, y ou need to incr ease the satur ation as the
lightne ss gets fur ther a way from 5 0%.
It’s subtle but little det ails lik e this add up , especially when a color is being
applied to a lar ge section of a UI.
But what if y ourbasecolor is alr eady he avily satur ated? Ho w do y ou incr ease
the satur ation if it’ s already at 100%?
Use per ceiv ed brightne ss to y our adv antage
Which of the se tw o color s do y ou think is lighter ?
The y ellow, right? W ell it turns out both color s actually ha ve the e xact same
“lightne ss” in terms of HSL:
So wh y do w e see the y ellow as lighter ? Well it turns out that e very hue has
an inher entperceivedbrightne ss due to ho w the human e ye per ceives color .
You can calculate the per ceived brightne ss of a color b y plugging its R GB
components into this f ormula:
Don’t let lightne ss kill y our satur ation 134Taking sample s of diff erent hue s with 100% satur ation and 5 0% lightne ss, w e
can get a good sense of the per ceived brightne ss of diff erent color s around
the color wheel:
As expected, y ellow has a higher per ceived brightne ss than blue . But what’ s
inter esting her e is that per ceived brightne ss doe sn’t simply change line arly
from the dark est hue to the lighte st hue — inste ad, ther e are thr ee separ ate
local minimums (r ed, gr een, and blue ) and thr ee local maximums (y ellow,
cyan, and magent a).
Changing brightne ss by rotating hue
On the sur face, this is cer tainly an inter esting thing to under stand about
color . But things get r eally inter esting when y ou realize ho w you can use this
knowledge in y our de signs.Don’t let lightne ss kill y our satur ation 135Normally when y ou w ant to change ho w light a color look s, you adjust the
lightne sscomponent:
While this doe s work to lighten or dark en a color , you of ten lose some of the
color ’sintensity — the color also look s closer to white or to black, not just
lighter or dark er.
Since diff erent hue s have a diff erent per ceived brightne ss, another w ay you
can change the brightne ss of a color is by rotating its h ue.
To mak e a color lighter , rotate the hue to wards the ne arest bright hue — 6 0°,
180°, or 300 °.
Don’t let lightne ss kill y our satur ation 136To mak e a color dark er, rotate the hue to wards the ne arest dark hue — 0 °,
120°, or 2 40°.
This can be r eally useful when tr ying to cr eate a palette f or a light color lik e
yellow. By gradually r otating the hue to wards mor e of an or ange as y ou
decr ease the lightne ss, the dark er shade s will f eel w arm and rich inste ad of
dull and br own:
You can of cour se combine the se appr oache s too , getting some of the
brightne ss by adjusting the hue and some fr om adjusting the lightne ss.
Don’t let lightne ss kill y our satur ation 137While this is a gr eat way to change a color ’s brightne ss without aff ecting its
intensity , it w orks best in small dose s. Don ’t rotate the hue mor e than 2 0-30°
or it will look lik e a tot ally diff erent color inste ad of just lighter or dark er.Don’t let lightne ss kill y our satur ation 138Greys don ’t ha ve to be gr ey
By definition, true gr ey has a satur ation of 0% — it doe sn’t have any actual
color in it at all.
But in pr actice , a lot of the color s that w ethink o fas gr ey are actually
satur ated quite he avily:
This satur ation is what mak es some gr eys feel cool and other gr eys feel

If you’ve ever pur chased light bulbs bef ore, you’ve had to mak e the decision
betw een “ warm white ” bulbs that giv e off a y ellow-ish light, and “ cool white ”
bulbs that giv e off a blue-ish light.

If you w ant y our gr eys to f eel cool, satur ate them with a bit of blue:
To giv e your gr eys a w armer f eel, satur ate them with a bit of y ellow or

Greys don ’t have to be gr ey 140To maint ain a consistent temper ature, don ’t forget to incr ease the satur ation
for the lighter and dark er shade s. If y ou don ’t, those shade s will look a bit
washed out compar ed to the gr eys that ar e closer to 5 0% lightne ss.
How much y ou w ant to satur ate y our gr eys is completely up to y ou — add
just a little if y ou only w ant to tip the temper ature slightly , or cr ank it up if
you w ant the inter face to le an str ongly in one dir ection or the other .Greys don ’t have to be gr ey 141Acce ssible doe sn’t ha ve to me an

To mak e sur e your de signs ar e acce ssible , the W eb Content A ccessibility
Guideline s (WCAG) recommend that normal te xt(under ~18p x)has a contr ast
ratio of at le ast 4 .5:1, and that lar ger te xt has a contr ast r atio of at le ast 3: 1.
For typical dark -text-on-a-light-back ground situations, meeting this
recommendation is pr etty e asy, but it gets a lot trickier when y ou st art
working with color .Flipping the contr ast
When using white te xt on a color ed back ground, y ou’d be surprised ho w
dark the color of ten needs to be to meet that 4 .5:1 contr ast r atio.
This can cr eate hier archy issue s when those elements ar en’t supposed to be
the f ocus of the page — dark color ed back grounds will r eally gr ab the user ’s
attention.
Accessible doe sn’t have to me an ugly 143You can solv e this pr oblem b yflipping the contra st. Inste ad of using light
text on a dark color ed back ground, use dark color ed te xt on a light color ed
back ground:
The color is still ther e to help suppor t the te xt, but it’ s way less in-y our-face
and doe sn’t inter fere as much with other actions on the page .
Rotating the hue
Even har der than white te xt on a color ed back ground is color edtext on a

a color f or some secondar y text inside a dark -color ed panel.
If you st art by taking the back ground color and simply adjusting the
lightne ss and satur ation, y ou’ll find that it’ s har d to meet the r ecommended
contr ast r atio without getting v ery close to pur e white .Accessible doe sn’t have to me an ugly 144You don ’t want the primar y text and the secondar y text to look the same , so
what else can y ou do ?
Well since some color s are brighter than other s, one w ay to incr ease the
contr ast without getting closer to white is to rotate the h uetowards a
brighter color , like cyan, magent a, or y ellow.
This can mak e it a lot e asier to mak e the te xt acce ssible while still k eeping it
color ful.Accessible doe sn’t have to me an ugly 145Don ’t rely on color alone
Color can be a f antastic w ay to enhance inf ormation and mak e it e asier to
under stand, but be car eful not to relyon it, or user s with color blindne ss will
have a har d time interpr eting y our UI.
Take the se metric car ds for example . With this de sign, someone who is r ed-
green colorblind can ’t easily tell if a metric has gotten better or w orse:
An e asy fix f or this is to also communicate that inf ormation in some other
way, like by adding icons to indicate if the change is positiv e or negativ e.What about something lik e a gr aph, wher e each tr end line has a diff erent
color ?
In situations lik e this, tr y relying on contra stinste ad of using completely
different color s. It’s much e asier f or someone who ’s colorblind to tell theDon’t rely on color alone 147difference betw een light and dark than it is f or them to tell the diff erence
betw een tw o distinct color s.
Always use color to suppor t something that y our de sign is alr eady sa ying;
never use it as the only me ans of communication.Don’t rely on color alone 148Creating DepthEmula te a light s ource
Have you e ver noticed ho w some elements in an inter face f eel lik e the y’re
raised off of the page , while other s feel lik e the y are inset into the
back ground?
Creating this eff ect might look complicated at fir st, but it actually only
requir es you to under stand one fundament al rule .Light come s from abo ve
Take a look at the panelling on this door :
Even though y ou’re just looking at a flat image , it’s still pr etty ob vious that
the panels on the door ar e raised. Wh y is that?
Notice ho w the top edge of the panel is lighter ? That’ s because it’ s angled
towards the sky and r eceiv es mor e light. Similarly , the bottom edge is dark er
because it’ s angled awayfrom the sky , receiving lesslight.
The only w ay those edge s could possibly be oriented that w ay is if the panel
itself is r aised, so that’ s how our br ains per ceive it.Emulate a light sour ce 151Now take a look at the panelling on this cabinet:
In this case it’ s cle ar that the panels ar einset because ther e’s a shado w at
the top indicating that the lip abo ve is blocking the light, and the bottom
edge is lighter , indicating that it’ s angled up ward.
To create this same sense of depth in y our de signs, all y ou need to do is
mimic the w ay light aff ects things in the r eal world.Emulate a light sour ce 152Simula ting light in a us er inter face
If you w ant an element to appe ar raised or inset, fir st figur e out what profile
you w ant that element to ha ve, then mimic ho w a light sour ce w ould inter act
with that shape .
Raised element s
For example , say you had a button and y ou w anted it to f eel r aised off of the
page , with per fectly flat edge s on the top and bottom:
Because the top and bottom edge s are both flat, it w ould be impossible to
see both of them at the same time . People gener ally look slightly do wnward
towards their scr eens, so f or the most natur al look, r eveal a little bit of the
top edge and hide the bottom edge .
Since the top edge is f acing up ward, mak e it slightly lighter than the f ace ofEmulate a light sour ce 153the button, usually using a top bor der or an inset bo x shado w with a slight
vertical off set:
Choose the lighter color b y hand inste ad of using a semi-tr anspar ent white
for be st results — simply o verlaying white can suck the satur ation out of the
underlying color .
Next, you need to account f or the f act that a r aised element will block some
of the light fr om r eaching the ar ea belo w the element.
Do this b y adding a small dark bo x shado w with a slight v ertical off set(you
only want the shado w to appe ar belo w the element) :
Don’t get carried a way with the blur r adius, a couple of pix els is plenty . The seEmulate a light sour ce 154sorts of shado ws should ha ve pretty sharp edge s — t ake a look at the
shado w cast b y the bottom of a w all outlet or windo w frame f or a r eal-world
example .
Inset element s
Say you’re de signing a “ well” component that should f eel lik e it’s recessed
into the page .
Looking slightly do wnward, only the bottom lip w ould be visible . Since it’ s
facing to wards the sky , give that edge a slightly lighter color using a bottom
border or inset shado w with a negativ e vertical off set:
Emulate a light sour ce 155The ar ea abo ve the w ell should block some of the light fr om r eaching the
very top of the w ell, so add a small dark inset bo x shado w with a slight
positiv e vertical off set to mak e sur e it doe sn’t pok e thr ough at the bottom:
This same tr eatment w orks for an y element that ma y need to appe ar inset,
for example te xt inputs and checkbo xes:
Emulate a light sour ce 156Don ’t get c arried a way
Once y ou under stand ho w to simulate light in an inter face, it can be
tempting to tink er away for hour s, tw eaking and tw eaking to see ho w closely
you can mimic the r eal world.
While this can be a fun e xercise, in pr actice it can le ad to inter faces that ar e
busy and uncle ar. Borr owing some visual cue s from the r eal world is a gr eat
way to add a bit of depth, but ther e’s no need to tr y and mak e things look
photo-r ealistic .Emulate a light sour ce 157Use shado ws to con vey ele vation
Shado ws can be mor e than just a flash y effect — used thought fully, the y let
you position elements on a vir tual z -axis to cr eate a me aningful sense of
depth.
Small shado ws with a tight blur r adius mak e an element f eel only slightly
raised off of the back ground, while lar ger shado ws with a higher blur r adius
make an element f eel much closer to the user :
The closer something f eels to the user , the mor e it will attr act their f ocus.You might use a smaller shado w for something lik e a button, wher e you w ant
the user to notice it but don ’t want it to dominate the page:
Medium shado ws ar e useful f or things lik e dropdo wns; elements that need
to sit a bit fur ther abo ve the r est of the UI:
Use shado ws to con vey ele vation 159Large shado ws ar e great for modal dialogs, wher e you really w ant to captur e
the user ’s attention:
Establishing an ele vation s ystem
Just lik e with color , typogr aphy, spacing, and sizing, defining a fix ed set of
shado ws will speed up y our w orkflo w and help maint ain consistenc y in y our
designs.
You don ’t need a ton of diff erent shado ws — fiv e options is usually plenty .Use shado ws to con vey ele vation 160Start by defining y our smalle st shado w and y our lar gest shado w, then fill in
the middle with shado ws that incr ease in siz e pretty line arly:
Combining shado ws with inter action
Shado ws ar en’t only useful f or positioning elements on the z -axis st atically ;
they’re a gr eat way to pr ovide visual cue s to the user as the y inter act with
elements, too .
For example , say you had a list of items wher e the user could click and dr ag
each item to sor t them. A dding a shado w to an item when a user click s it
makes it feel lik e it pops f orward abo ve the other items in the list, and mak es
it cle ar to the user that the y can dr ag it:
Use shado ws to con vey ele vation 161Similarly , you can mak e a button f eel lik e it’s being pr essed into the page
when a user click s it b y switching to a smaller shado w, or perhaps r emo ving
the shado w altogether :
Using shado ws in a me aningful w ay like this is a gr eat way to hack the
process of choosing what sor t of shado w an element should ha ve. Don ’t
think about the shado w itself , think about wher e you w ant the element to sit
on the z -axis and assign it a shado w accor dingly .Use shado ws to con vey ele vation 162Shado ws can ha ve tw o par ts
Ever inspected a r eally nice shado w on a site and noticed the y were actually
using twoshado ws?
Ther e’s a method to this madne ss, and it’ s actually pr etty simple and mak es a
lot of sense .
When y ou see someone combining tw o shado ws, the y’re not just
experimenting r andomly until things look nice , the y’re using e ach shado w to
do a specific job .
The fir st shado w is lar ger and sof ter, with a consider able v ertical off set and
large blur r adius. It simulate s the shado w cast behind an object b y a dir ect
light sour ce.The second shado w is tighter and dark er, with le ss of a v ertical off set and a
smaller blur r adius. It simulate s the shado wed ar eaunderne athan object
wher e even ambient light has a har d time r eaching.
Using tw o shado ws lik e this giv es you a lot mor e contr ol than y ou’d get with
a single shado w — y ou can k eep the lar ger shado w nice and subtle while stillShado ws can ha ve two par ts 164making the shado w closer the element’ s edge s nice and defined.
Accounting f or ele vation
As an object gets fur ther a way from a sur face, the small, dark shado w
created b y a lack of ambient light slo wly disappe ars(go ahe ad, tr y it out with
something on y our de sk).Shado ws can ha ve two par ts 165So if y ou’re going to use this tw o-shado w technique in y our o wn pr ojects,
make sur e you mak e that shado w mor e subtle f or shado ws that r epresent a
higher ele vation.
It should be quite distinct f or your lo west ele vation, and almost (or
complet ely)invisible at y our highe st ele vation.Shado ws can ha ve two par ts 166Even fla t de signs c an ha ve depth
When most people t alk about “ flat de sign”, the y me an de signing without
shado ws, gr adients, or an y other eff ects that tr y to mimic ho w light inter acts
with things in the r eal-world.
But the most eff ectiv e flat de signs still con vey depth, the y just do it in a
different w ay.Creating depth with color
In gener al(especially with shade s of the same color) , lighter objects f eel
closer to us and dark er objects f eel fur ther a way.
Make an element lighter than the back ground color to mak e it f eel lik e it’s
raised off of the page , or dark er than the back ground color if y ou w ant it to
feel inset lik e a w ell:
This is just as applicable to non-flat de signs, too — color is just another tool
in your toolbelt f or con veying dist ance .Even flat de signs can ha ve depth 168Using s olid shado ws
Another w ay to communicate depth in a flat de sign is to use shor t, vertically
offset shado ws with no blur r adius at all.
It’s a gr eat way to mak e a car d or button st and off the page a little bit without
sacrificing that flat ae sthetic .Even flat de signs can ha ve depth 169Overlap element s to cr eate la yers
One of the most eff ectiv e ways to cr eate depth is to o verlap diff erent
elements to mak e it f eel lik e a de sign has multiple layers.
For example , inste ad of cont aining a car d entir ely within another element,
offset it so it cr osse s the tr ansition betw een tw o diff erent back grounds:
You could also mak e an element t aller than its par ent, so it o verlaps on both
sides:
Overlapping elements can add depth to smaller components too , for
example the contr ols on this car ousel:
Overlapping image s
This technique can w ork gr eat with image s as w ell, but without specialOverlap elements to cr eate la yers 171consider ation it’ s easy for overlapping image s to clash.
A simple trick f or avoiding this is to giv e the image s an “ invisible bor der” —
one that matche s the back ground color — so ther e’s alw ays a bit of a gap
betw een image s:
You’ll still cr eate the appe arance of la yers but with none of the ugly clashing.Overlap elements to cr eate la yers 172Working with Image sUse good photo s
Bad photos will ruin a de sign, e ven if e verything else about it look s great.
If your de sign needs photogr aphy and y ou’re not a t alented photogr apher ,
you’ve got tw o options:
1.Hire a pr ofessional photogr apher .
If you need v ery specific photos f or your pr oject, entrust a pr ofessional.
Taking gr eat photos isn ’t just about using an e xpensiv e camer a, it’s
about lighting, composition, color — skills that t ake years to de velop .2.Use high quality stock photogr aph y.
If your needs ar e mor e generic , ther e are tons of gr eat resour ces out
there wher e you can pur chase gr eat stock photos. Ther e are even site s
like Unsplash that off er be autiful photogr aphy for free.
Whate ver you do , don ’t design using placeholder image s and e xpect to be
able to t ake some photos with y our smar tphone and s wap them in later . It
never w orks.Use good photos 175Text needs consistent contr ast
Ever tried to slap a he adline on a big her o image , only to find that no matter
what color y ou tried f or the te xt, it w as still har d to r ead?
That’ s because the pr oblem isn ’t the te xt, it’ s the image .
The pr oblem with back ground image s
Photos can be v ery dynamic , with a lot of r eally light ar eas, and a lot of r eally
dark ar eas. White te xt might look gr eat in the dark ar eas, but it gets lost in
the light ar eas. Dark te xt look s great in the light ar eas, but gets lost in the
dark ar eas.To solv e this pr oblem, y ou need to reduce the dynamics in the image to
make the contr ast betw een the te xt and the back ground mor e consistent.
Add an o verla y
One w ay to incr ease the o verall te xt contr ast is to add a semi-tr anspar ent
overlay to the back ground image .
Text needs consistent contr ast 177A black o verlay will tone do wn the light ar eas and help light te xt st and out,
while a white o verlay will brighten up the dark ar eas and help dark te xt st and
out.
Lower the image contr ast
One of the compr omise s you mak e when using an o verlay is that y ou’re
lightening or dark ening the whole image , not just the pr oblem ar eas.
If you w ant mor e contr ol, another solution is to lo wer the contr ast of the
image itself :
Lowering the contr ast will change ho w light or dark the image f eels o verall,
so mak e sur e to adjust the brightne ss to compensate .Text needs consistent contr ast 178Coloriz e the image
Another w ay to help te xt st and out against an image is to coloriz e the image
with a single color .
Some photo editing sof tware include s this as a fir st-class f eature, but if
yours doe sn’t, you can cr eate this eff ect in thr ee steps:
1.Lower the image contr ast, to balance things out a bit.
2.Desaturate the image , to r emo ve any existing color .
3.Add a s olid fill , using the “ multiply ” blend mode .
This can also be a gr eat way to mak e a back ground image pair mor e nicely
with y our e xisting br and color s.Text needs consistent contr ast 179Add a te xt shado w
If you w ant to pr eserve a bit mor e of the dynamics in a back ground image , a
text shado w can be a gr eat way to incr ease contr ast only wher e you need it
most.
You w ant it to look mor e like a subtle glo w than an actual shado w, so use a
large blur r adius and don ’t add an y kind of off set.
It’s still a good ide a to r educe the o verall image contr ast, but combining that
with a te xt shado w me ans y ou can r educe it a little le ss.Text needs consistent contr ast 180Everything has an intended siz e
Everyone kno ws that scaling bitmap image s to lar ger than their original siz e
is a bad ide a — the y immediately f eel “ fuzzy” and lose their definition.
But that’ s not the only w ay you can go wr ong with scaling, e ven when y ou
think y ou’re pla ying it saf e.
Don ’t scale up icons
If you’re de signing something that could use some lar ge icons (like ma ybe
the “f eatures” section o f a landing page ), you might instinctiv ely gr ab your
favorite S VG icon set and bump up the siz e until the y fit y our needs.
They’re vector image s after all, so the quality isn ’t going to suff er if y ou
increase the siz e, right?
While it’ s true that v ector image s won’t degr ade in quality when y ou incr ease
their siz e, icons that w ere drawn at 16 –24px are ne ver going to look v ery
professional when y ou blo w them up to 3x or 4x their intended siz e. The y
lack det ail, and alw ays feel dispr opor tionately “ chunky ”.
If small icons ar e all y ou’ve got, tr y enclosing them inside another shape and
giving the shape a back ground color :
This lets y ou keep the actual icon closer to its intended siz e, while still filling
the lar ger space .
Everything has an intended siz e 182Don ’t scale do wn s creenshot s
Say you w ant to include a scr eenshot of y our app on that same f eatures
page .
If you take a full-siz e scr eenshot and shrink it b y 70% to mak e it fit, y ou’ll end
up with an image that’ s trying to cr am w ay too much det ail into f ar too little
space .
The 16p x font in y our app become s a 4p x font in y our scr eenshot, and
visitor s will be squinting with their e yeballs tw o inche s from the scr een,
struggling to mak e out what all that te xt sa ys.
If you w ant to include a det ailed scr eenshot in y our de sign, t ake the
screenshot at a smaller scr een siz e(like ma ybe y our t ablet la yout) and sa ve aEverything has an intended siz e 183lot of space f or it so y ou don ’t have to shrink it as much:
Or consider t aking just a par tial scr eenshot, so y ou can displa y it in le ss
space without needing to scale it do wn:
Everything has an intended siz e 184If you really need to fit a whole-app scr eenshot in a tight space , try drawing
a simplified v ersion of the UI with det ails r emo ved and small te xt replaced
with simple line s:
It’ll still communicate the big-pictur e de sign without tempting visitor s to tr y
and mak e out all of the det ails.
Don ’t scale do wn icons, either
Just as icons dr awn to be used at 16p x look chunky when y ou scale them up ,
icons intended to be used at lar ger siz es look chopp y and fuz zy when y ou
scale them do wn.
The most e xtreme e xample of this ar e favicons, those little icons y ou see

When y ou’re depending on user -uploaded image s, you don ’t have the lux ury
of fine-tuning contr ast, car efully adjusting color s, or cr opping the per fect
frame .
While y ou’ll alw ays be at y our user s’ mer cy to some e xtent, ther earea few
things y ou can do to mak e sur e their content doe sn’t completely undermine
your de sign.
Contr ol the shape and siz e
Displa ying user -uploaded image s at their intrinsic aspect r atio can r eally
throw off a la yout, e specially if ther e are a lot of image s on the scr een at
once .
Inste ad of letting user s wreak ha voc on y our page structur e, center their
image s inside fix ed cont ainer s, cropping out an ything that doe sn’t fit.
This is r eally e asy to do with CS S the se da ys by making the image a
back ground image , and setting the background-size proper ty to cover.
Beware user -uploaded content 188Prevent back ground bleed
When a user pr ovide s an image with a back ground color that’ s similar to the
back ground in y our UI, the image and the back ground can bleed together ,
causing the image to lose its shape .
Inste ad of tr ying to solv e this with a bor der, try using a subtle inner bo x
shado w:
Beware user -uploaded content 189Borders will of ten clash with the color s in the image , while most people will
barely e ven realize the shado w is ther e.
If you don ’t like the slight “ inset” look y ou get fr om using a bo x shado w, a
semi-tr anspar ent inner bor der w orks great, too .
Beware user -uploaded content 190Finishing T ouche sSuper char ge the def ault s
You don ’t alw ays ha ve to add ne w elements to a de sign to add flar e — ther e
are a lot of w ays to liv en up a page b y “super char ging” what’ s already ther e.
For example , if your de sign include s a bulleted list, tr y replacing the bullets
with icons:
Checkmark s and arr ows ar e great generic choice s for a lot of situations, but
you can also use something mor e specific to y our content, lik e a padlock
icon f or a list of security -related f eatures:
Similarly , if you’re working on a te stimonial tr y “promoting” the quote s into
visual elements b y incr easing the siz e and changing the color :
Links are another gr eat candidate f or special styling. Y ou can do something
as simple as changing the color and f ont w eight, or something as f ancy as a
thick and color ful custom underline that par tially o verlaps the te xt:
Super char ge the def aults 193If you’re working on a f orm, using custom checkbo xes and r adio buttons is
an easy way to add some color to the de sign:
Just using one of y our br and color s for the selected st ates inste ad of the
browser def aults is of ten enough to t ake something fr om f eeling boring to
feeling polished and w ell-de signed.Super char ge the def aults 194Add color with accent bor ders
If you’re not a gr aphic de signer , how do y ou add that dash of visual flair to
your UI that other de signs get fr om be autiful photogr aphy or color ful
illustr ations ?
One simple trick that can mak e a big diff erence is to add color ful accent
borders to par ts of y our inter face that w ould other wise f eel a bit bland.
For example , acr oss the top of a car d:
…or to highlight activ e navigation items:
…or along the side of an aler t me ssage:
…or as a shor t accent underne ath a he adline:
Add color with accent bor ders 196…or even acr oss the top of y our entir e layout:
It doe sn’t take any graphic de sign t alent to add a color ed rectangle to y our
UI, and it can go a long w ay towards making something f eel mor e
“designed. ”Add color with accent bor ders 197Decor ate y our back grounds
Even if y ou do a gr eat job with hier archy, spacing, and typogr aphy,
sometime s a de sign will still f eel a little bit plain.
A great way to br eak up some of the monoton y without dr astically altering
the de sign is to add some e xcitement to a f ew of y our back grounds.
Change the back ground color
One w ay to add some e xcitement to a back ground is to simply change the
color .
This w orks great for emphasizing an individual panel, as w ell as f or adding
some distinction betw een entir e page sections.
For a mor e ener getic look, y ou could e ven use a slight gr adient:
For be st results, use tw o hue s that ar e no mor e than about 30 ° apar t.Decor ate y our back grounds 199Use a r epe ating pa ttern
Another appr oach is to add a subtle r epeatable pattern, lik e this one fr om

You don ’t have to nece ssarily r epeat it acr oss the entir e back ground, either
— a pattern de signed to r epeat along a single edge can look gr eat, too .
Keep the contr ast betw een the back ground and the pattern pr etty lo w to

Inste ad of decor ating an entir e back ground, y ou can also tr y including an

Imagine y ou’re de signing a ne w feature for an app y ou’re working on.
You’ve spent a ton of time cr afting the per fect r ealistic sample dat a, picking
out username s and a vatars, and putting together a be autiful and electrif ying

You code it all up and deplo y it to pr oduction. But when an e xcited user
click s the ne w item in the na v, the y see this:
If you’re de signing something that depends on user -gener ated content, the
empty st ate should be a priority , not an af terthought.
Try incorpor ating an image or illustr ation to gr ab the user ’s attention, and
emphasizing the call-to-action to encour age them to t ake the ne xt step:
Don’t overlook empty st ates 204If you’re working on something that has a bunch of suppor ting UI lik e tabs or
filter s, consider hiding that stuff entir ely. Ther e’s no point in pr esenting a
bunch of actions that don ’t do an ything until the user has cr eated some
content.
Empty st ates are a user ’s first inter action with a ne w pr oduct or f eature. Use
them as an oppor tunity to be inter esting and e xciting — don ’t settle f or plain
and boring.Don’t overlook empty st ates 205Use fewer bor ders
When y ou need to cr eate separ ation betw een tw o elements, tr y to r esist
immediately r eaching f or a bor der.
While bor ders are a gr eat way to distinguish tw o elements fr om one another ,
they aren’t the only w ay, and using too man y of them can mak e your de sign
feel bus y and clutter ed.Use a bo x shado w
Box shado ws do a gr eat job of outlining an element lik e a bor der w ould, but
can be mor e subtle and accomplish the same goal without being as
distr acting.
This appr oach w orks best when the element y ou ar e applying the bo x
shado w to is not the same color as the back ground.Use fewer bor ders 207Use tw o diff erent back ground color s
Giving adjacent elements slightly diff erent back ground color s is usually all
you need to cr eate distinction betw een them.
If you’re alr eady using diff erent back ground color s in addition to a bor der, try
remo ving the bor der; you might not need it.Use fewer bor ders 208Add e xtra spacing
What better w ay to cr eate separ ation betw een elements than to simply
increase the separ ation ?
Spacing things fur ther apar t is a gr eat way to cr eate distinction betw een
groups of elements without intr oducing an y new UI at all.Use fewer bor ders 209Think out side the bo x
Most people ha ve a lot of pr econceiv ed notions about ho w cer tain
components ar e supposed to look. But just because w e’ve been conditioned
to belie ve that ther e’s only one w ay to de sign a par ticular component,
doesn’t me an it’ s true .
For example , pictur e a dr opdo wn menu. Y ou’re probably picturing a white
box with a bit of a dr op shado w and a list of link s stacked inside of it:
But who sa ys a dr opdo wn needs to be a boring list of link s? It’s just a floating
box on the scr een, y ou can do an ything y ou w ant with it.
Break it into sections, use multiple columns, add suppor ting te xt or color ful
icons — do something fun with it!
And don ’t just stop at dr opdo wns; what about something lik e a t able?Think outside the bo x 211When y ou imagine a t able, you pr obably think of columns that e ach cont ain
one specific piece of dat a:
Table s don ’thaveto w ork this w ay, though — if a column doe sn’t need to be
sortable, ther e’s no r eason y ou can ’t combine it with a r elated column and
introduce some inter esting hier archy:
Think outside the bo x 212Table content doe sn’t have to be plain te xt, either . Add image s if it mak es
sense , or intr oduce some color to enrich the e xisting dat a:
How about r adio buttons ? Ther e’s nothing mor e boring than a st ack of labels
with little cir cles next to them.
Think outside the bo x 213If a set of r adio buttons ar e an impor tant par t of the UI y ou’re de signing, tr y
something lik e select able car ds inste ad:
Don’t let y our e xisting belief s hold back y our de signs — constr aints ar e
powerful but sometime s a bit of fr eedom is just what y ou need to t ake an
inter face to the ne xt level.Think outside the bo x 214Leveling U pLeveling up
Hopefully af ter reading this book y ou feel much mor e confident in y our
ability to mak e something look a wesome , without r elying on a de signer . But
even though w e’ve tried our be st to cr am in e very good ide a we could
possibly think of , ther e will alw ays be mor e out ther e to le arn.
Here are two of the be st ways you can continue to hone y our skills, and add
new tools to y our toolbelt.
Look f or decisions y ou w ouldn ’t ha ve made
Whene ver you stumble acr oss a de sign y ou really lik e, ask y ourself:
“Did the de signer do an ything her e tha t I ne ver would ha ve thought t o do ?”
Maybe it’ s the w ay the y inverted the back ground color on a datepick er:
…or the w ay the y positioned a button within a te xt input inste ad of on the
outside:
…or something as simple as using tw o diff erent f ont color s for a he adline:
Paying attention to the se sor ts of unintuitiv e decisions is a gr eat way to
disco ver ne w ide as that y ou can apply to y our o wn de signs.
Rebuild y our f avorite inter face s
The absolute be st way to notice the little det ails that mak e a de sign lookLeveling up 217really polished is to r ecreate that de sign fr om scr atch, without peeking a t the
developer t ools.
When y ou’re trying to figur e out wh y your v ersion look s diff erent than the
original, y ou’ll disco ver trick s like “reduce y our line height f or he adings ”,
“add letter -spacing to upper case te xt”, or “ combine multiple shado ws” all on
your o wn.
By continually studying the w ork that inspir es you with a car eful e ye, you’ll
be picking up de sign trick s for years to come .
